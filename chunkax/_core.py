    """
    Returns a new function that applies `fun` to sliced (chunked) segments of the
    input arrays along specified axes, then reassembles the partial outputs into a
    single array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : Callable
        The function to be applied on each chunk. It should accept the same positional
        and keyword arguments as the returned function, but on smaller slices.
    sizes : int or tuple
        The size(s) of each chunk along the axes in `in_axes`. If a single int is
        provided, it is repeated for each axis in `in_axes[0]`.
    in_axes : int or tuple or Sequence[tuple], optional
        The dimension indices along which inputs are chunked. If a single tuple is
        provided, it applies to every input array; otherwise, it should match the
        number of input arrays. `None` entries indicate no chunking for that dimension.
        Defaults to `(-1,)`.
    out_axes : None or int or tuple, optional
        The dimension indices along which the output chunks are placed. If `None`,
        reuses the value for `in_axes` for the first argument. Defaults to `None`.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable
        A wrapped version of `fun` that splits inputs into chunks, applies `fun` on each
        chunk, and combines the resulting patch outputs into a single array.

    Notes
    -----
    - By default, the last chunk in a dimension will also be sized as in `sizes`, which
      creates overlaps if the arrayâ€™s shape is not a multiple of `sizes`. Adjust logic
      if smaller final chunks or different stitching behavior is desired.
    - Currently the transformation only works on functions whose output has the same size
      as the input along specified `in_axes` and `out_axes`, e.g. this is fine:
        (B, H, W, 3) -> (B, 10, H, W) with in_axes=(-3, -2) and out_axes=(-2, -1)
